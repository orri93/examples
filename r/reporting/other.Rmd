# Mixing programming languages in R Markdown


Other language engines

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html

# Dependencies

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

## R code

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

# Python code

```{python}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x.split(' '))
```
# Sharing variables between programming languages

## A normal R code chunk

```{r}
x = 42
print(x)
```

## Modify an R variable

In the following chunk, the value of `x` on the right hand side
is `r x`, which was defined in the previous chunk.

```{r}
x = x + 12
print(x)
```

## A Python chunk

This works fine and as expected. 

```{python}
x = 42 * 2
print(x) 
```
## Modify a Python variable

```{python}
x = x + 18 
print(x)
```

Retrieve the value of `x` from the Python session again:

```{r}
py$x
```
